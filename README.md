### How to Run

At the start of the program, the user is prompted to enter data pertaining
to a food truck to include its name, type of food served, and rating on a 1-5
scale. The user may enter "quit" during the truck name prompt to stop entering
data.

At this point, the user is provided a menu in which they may view all of the
entered trucks data, the average rating for all trucks, the highest rated
food truck, or quit to exit the program.

### Lessons Learned

The biggest lesson learned in this program was that main can be kept short
and sweet. Most of the code can be separated into applicable methods to keep
the main concise and easy to follow.
